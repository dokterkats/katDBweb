title: Saber Fight VR (SteamVR)
---

## Rating (1-3)
⭐⭐

### Notes
Its not perfect, but not bad. It is significantly better than without a Kat Walk. THe direction is a bit odd.

### Scoring explanation:
Saber Fight VR *does not require* a Joystick Press in order to sprint.
There are *small* randomly generated factory maps, its not aesthetically interesting, however, it is largely about the practive of lightsaber and force wielding, with the walking as a side effect.
The movement is *fast* and *abrubt*. Needs to be revisit to test settings.
It is *not sure* if the game supports decoupled head-body movement. Something felt off while testing and it might have forced controller direction.
The game was tested on a *Oculus Rift S* on the *Kat Walk C2+*
