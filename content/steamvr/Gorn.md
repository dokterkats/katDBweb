title: Gorn (SteamVR)
---

## Rating (1-3)
⭐⭐⭐

### Notes
There is a large arena. I had lots of fun playing in this arena on the Kat Walk C! ~Dokterkat
You have to set the movement type to Smooth Locomotion in-game.

#### Scoring explanation:
Gorn *does not require* a Joystick Press in order to sprint.
There *is* a large world to explore.
The movement speed *does* feel realistic.
The game *does* support decoupled head-body movement.
The game was tested on a *Valve Index* on the *Kat Walk C1*
