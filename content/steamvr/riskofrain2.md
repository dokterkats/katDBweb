title: Risk of Rain 2 VR Mod (SteamVR)
---

## Rating (1-3)
⭐⭐⭐

### Notes
If it's not working, the Gateway goes to strange defaults when this mod is on, make sure it's on the usual settings: Body decoupled, JStick controller, etc. HIGHLY recommend autosprint mod, and item-sharing mod, because going into VR at all is significantly more difficult than playing normally, given that the #1 survival strategy is dodging/running, for 85% of playtime on even the easiest level, and even more on anything more difficult.

#### Scoring explanation:
There is *enormous* world to explore.
The game *speed* might not be realistic. But it is fast and that is perfect for this game.

This game was tested on a *Oculus Rift S* using the *Kat Walk C2* on *Gateway 2.1.0*.
