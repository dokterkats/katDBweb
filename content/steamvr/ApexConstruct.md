title: Apex Construct (SteamVR)
---

## Rating (1-3)
⭐

### Notes
It is capable of linear locomotion by joystick sensitivity testing, but does not respond accordingly with the Kat Walk C.

#### Scoring explanaion:
Apex Construct *does not require* a Joystick Press in order to sprint. There is no sprint, although variable speeds exist, when using the Kat Walk C alone, it is always simply "fast"
There are *several* isolated maps, which are each somewhat narrow
The movement speed is always *fast*. Reggardless of the Gateway settings. 
The game *does not* support decoupled head-body movement.
The game was tested on a *Oculus Rift S* using the *Kat Walk C2+*
