title: Grapple Tournament (SteamVR)
---

## Rating (1-3)
⭐⭐⭐

### Notes
Practically made for Kat Walk! - If one's sense of balance can reconcile the grappling motion without puking. Free Demo available.

### Scoring explanation:
Grapple Tournament *does not require* a Joystick Press in order to sprint.
There *are multiple* clean map designs. Overwatch style FFA FPS but smaller, probably better for enegry levels.
The movement speed is pretty *fast*, but it feels good.
The game *does* support decoupled head-body movement.
The game was tested on a *Oculus Rift S* on the *Kat Walk C2+*
