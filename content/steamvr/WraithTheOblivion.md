title: "Wraith: The Oblivion - Afterlife (SteamVR)"
---

## Rating (1-3)
⭐⭐

### Notes
Set to HMD, run source to none, running isn't very fast in this game

#### Scoring explanation:
The sprinting and walking were so similar in this game I couldn't tell if pressing the joystick or linear locomotion was sprinting.
The speed in this game feels realistic for walking, but not for running. The run speed is capped by the game.
There *is* a large world to explore.
The game *does* support decoupled head-body movement.

This game was tested on a *Oculus Quest* using the *Kat Walk C2* on *Gateway 2.1.0*.
