title: Blade And Sorcery (SteamVR)
---

## Rating (1-3)
⭐⭐⭐

### Notes


#### Scoring explanation:
Blade And Sorcery *does not require* a Joystick Press in order to sprint. Sprinting occurs when the user "pumps" their hands as if they were running in real life.
There *are multiple* sandboxes with varying sizes to explore.
The movement speed *does* feel realistic.
The game *does* support decoupled head-body movement.
The game was tested on a *Valve Index* on the *Kat Walk C1*

#### Update October 24, 2022
The game has also been tested on a *Kat Walk C2* using *Gateway version 2.09*.
