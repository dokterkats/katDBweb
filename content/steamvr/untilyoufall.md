### Notes
I have not found the ideal movement orientation despite experimenting with all settings and resetting direction sensor..  Frequently walking forward suddenly sends me sideways or forty-five degrees off center. ~Ender's VRcade

#### Scoring explanaion:
There *is* a large world to explore. It is a linear progression wave fighting game. It is not open world but you can comfortably walk from point a to point b.
It is single speed walking except for "dash" movements with thumbstick.
The game *does* support decoupled head-body movement when set to head oriented movement in-game.
Tested on a *HP Reverb G2 with Index Controllers* on the *Kat Walk C2* on *Gateway Version 2.10*.
