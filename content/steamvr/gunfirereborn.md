title: Gunfire Reborn VR Mod (SteamVR)
---

## Rating (1-3)
⭐⭐

### Notes
Default movement Gateway bindings work.  I did not noticed decoupled movement.  There is a button for sprinting you need to use on your VR controller.  Since this game is modified from a flat game, you cannot hold your primary weapon in your left hand.

#### Scoring explanation:
There *is* a large world to explore.
The movement speed might feel unrealistically *fast*
The game *does* support decoupled head-body movement.
There is a delay in registering the starting and stopping of movement. 

This game was tested on a *Reverb G2 with Index Controllers* using the *Kat Walk C2* on *Gateway 2.1.0*.
