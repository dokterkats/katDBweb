title: No Man's Sky (SteamVR)

## Rating (1-3)
⭐⭐⭐

### Notes
After swapping the thumbstick button clicks so move and run on all on the left controller running could be experience. Running seems spiritic and seems to toggle itself off almost instantly 90% of the time. I did manage to run and deplete my stamina but only a couple times during my testing. Running and isn't likely something that can be relied on. Likely need to keep using the button press in order to trigger it. 
Best results with World Orientation, Smooth Movement, Body Off

#### Scoring explanation:
There *are* large worlds to explore.
The movement speed *does* feel realistic.
The game *does* support decoupled head-body movement.

This game was tested on a *Pimax 5K Plus (Index Controllers)* using the *Kat Walk C2* on *Gateway 2.1.0*.
