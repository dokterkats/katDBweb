### Notes


#### Scoring explanaion:
AltspaceVR *does not require* a Joystick Press in order to sprint.
There *is* a large world to explore.
The movement speed feels too *slow* to be realistic.
The game *does* support decoupled head-body movement.
The game was tested on a *Valve Index* on the *Kat Walk C1*
