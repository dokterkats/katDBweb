title: Wind Lands 2 (SteamVR)
---

## Rating (1-3)
⭐⭐⭐

### Notes
Walking includes a bit of continuing sliding motion as a default, but feels like natural inertia. You will not be walking primarily, its is intented for grappling. But there are plenty of movemetns to walk and the Kat Walk feels like a beautiful companion to the grappling in this game.

#### Scoring explanation:
Wind Lands 2 *does not require* a Joystick Press in order to sprint.
There are multiple *huge* worlds to explore.
The movement speed is quite *fast*, but it feels goodc.
The game *does* support decoupled head-body movement.
The game was tested on a *Oculus Rift S* on the *Kat Walk C2+*
