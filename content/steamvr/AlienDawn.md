### Notes


#### Scoring explanation:
Alien Dawn *does require* a Joystick Press in order to sprint.
There *is* a large world to explore.
The movement speed *does* feel realistic.
The game *does* support decoupled head-body movement when set to head oriented movement in-game.
The game was tested on a *Valve Index* on the *Kat Walk C1*
