title: Boiling Steel (SteamVR)
---

## Rating (1-3)
⭐⭐

### Notes
It feels different between the Prologue(demo) and the main game "Boiling Steel"

### Scoring explanation:
Boiling Steel *does not require* a Joystick Press in order to sprint. But there is a Dash movement on button activation. It dashes you forward if you are actively walking, and backwards when you are standing still.
There world is *large* and the game feels like a story-driven RPG.
The movement speed feels too *slow* to be realistic.
The game *does* support decoupled head-body movement.
It was tested on a *Oculus Rift S* on the *Kat Walk C2+*
