### Notes
The user who submitted couldn't get it to work. Movement was always sideways from the looking direction. A revisit is welcome!

#### Scoring explanaion:
The game *does not require* a Joystick Press in order to sprint.
There *is* a large world to explore.
The game *does not* support decoupled head-body movement.
The movement speed *did not* feel realistic.
The game was tested on a *Oculus Quest* on the *Kat Walk C2* on *Gateway version 2.0.9*.
