Full body tracking (FBT) is yet another development in the VR Industry that aims to increase the immersion. Full body tracking gear tracks every movement of the body in real-time to make VR more realistic, exciting, and immersive. Usually wearable body tracking devices are attached to the userâ€™s body that helps track every little movement. But there are also different kind of software available that tracks the users body externally using for example a Xbox Kinect or a Webcam.

Here is a list that covers the different FBT solutions:

# SteamVR/Ligthouse Trackers

There are several SteamVR Lighthouse trackers available. For example, at the time of writing, there are 3 generations of VIVE Trackers. There are also the newer Tundra trackers. 

A big advantage of these Basestation based trackers is that they are very accurate when everything is set up properly, there is no drift.

One disadvantage is the price. A set of 3 Vive trackers 3.0 costs about $390, this will track your feet and  your waist. Another disadvantage is that occlusion can occur. This occurs when the trackers are no longer visible to the base stations. This can occur for example by sitting under a blanket or because there is a plant or another person between the tracker and the basestation. 

# SlimeVR Trackers

SlimeVR FBT makes full-body tracking more convenient and affordable by using inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors and a Wi-Fi connection to your PC. No cameras or basestations are required. 

An advantage of SlimeVR trackers are that they do not suffer from occlusion. The trackers just keep working when you lie under a blanket. They also promise a 15-hour battery life. The price is also very attractive compared to Lighthouse trackers. For a set of 7 trackers and 3 AUX units, you pay $295. This set tracks your waist, your knees, your chest, your feet and your elbows. The SlimeVR trackers also work standalone on the Oculus Quest.

One drawback of the SlimeVR trackers is that they are a bit less accurate. For good tracking that suits your body you have to play with different parameters in the software
