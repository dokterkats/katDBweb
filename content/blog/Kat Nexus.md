## Introduction:
The Kat Nexus is a device that connects a KatVR locomotion device like the Kat Walk C(2) or Kat Loco S to play on platforms that do not run on PCVR. You do not need a Kat Nexus for use headsets that you connect to the PC. You also do not need a Kat Nexus to use the Quest on the PC using Airlink or Virtual Desktop. <br>

## How it works
The KAT Nexus connects with a KAT VR device via a cable, and wirelessly with your HMD. To make everything work you will have to side load Kat VR Software to your headset and it's ready to go. <br>
All Free Locomotion games on the Meta Quest platform will be compatible without the need of integration by the game developer. <br>

## What it is
Hardware wise it is just a small adapter that connects via cable to KAT VR device and via wifi to your HMD. It transfers all the signal between the HMD and the KAT VR device, including the haptic signal. <br>

## When do you need one?
The goal is to support all the standalone VR platforms with a single adapter. While support of other platforms is in the latest stages of development, KAT Nexus will VERY soon unlock compatibility with Pico Neo, VIVE, PlayStation VR and more yet to come! <br>

KatVR has not tested the Quest Pro yet, but they will in near future. Based on the technological principle, they are not expecting any issues because the integration is carried out for the entire quest platform. But they will definitely inform the community as soon as they confirm with certainty that things work smoothly with the Quest Pro. <br>

## What KatVR devices does it support?
Nexus will work with all KAT VR devices operating in KAT Gateway software - KAT Walk C 1 / C2 / C2+ / loco / loco S. <br>

It will not work with Kat VR devices that use the Kat I/O Software – KAT Walk / KAT Walk Premium / Kat Walk mini / Kat Walk Mini S <br>
