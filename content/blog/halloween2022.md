{{< column >}}
To celebrate this, I am happy to announce the first ever giveaway on the KatDB Website!

You can contribute by playing a game on your KatVR device,  while playing you want to take note of the following things:
* Does the game require a joystick press to sprint?
* Does the game have a option for HMD/Head oriented movement? If so, is it set by default or do you need to change it in the Settings?
* Are the worlds in the game even big enough to fully walk around in?
* Does the game have a low delay in registering the starting and stopping of movement?

### About DEVOUR:
[DEVOUR](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1274570/DEVOUR/) is a co-op horror survival game for 1-4 players. You play a cult member who must try to stop the possessed cult leader from killing you (and your friends). The game can also be played single player if you prefer that. It runs quite well on the Kat Walk. You get the change to increase your in-game walking speed after your first game by spending a token on the speed upgrade.
