### Notes
The game uses a walk-in-place locomotion type. The walking in place also registers on the Kat Walk C.

#### Scoring explanaion:
Grid Clash *does not require* a Joystick Press in order to sprint.
There *is* a large world to explore.
The movement speed *does* feel realistic.
The game *does not* support decoupled head-body movement.
