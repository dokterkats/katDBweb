## Rating (1-3)
⭐⭐

### Notes
In the ingame menu, you can change the walking speed. There's 3 choices (slow, medium, and fast). Choose "fast". 

#### Scoring explanaion:
Fallout 4 VR *does require* a Joystick Press in order to sprint.
There *is* a large world to explore.
The movement speed feels too *slow* to be realistic.
The game *does* support decoupled head-body movement when set to head oriented movement in-game.
