title: FORWARNED (SteamVR)

## Rating (1-3)
⭐⭐⭐

### Notes
There is a "Always Sprint" option in the settings, I recommend turning this on.

#### Scoring explanaion:
FORWARNED *does not require* a Joystick Press in order to sprint.
There *is* a large world to explore.
The movement speed *does* feel realistic.
The game *does* support decoupled head-body movement.
