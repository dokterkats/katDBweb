# This is a database of game states for **KatVR Products**.

Welcome to KatDB! A website for KatVR game compatibility reports.

KatDB is a crowd-sourced project that relies on the community. You can contribute [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1wP7F_-mtxvMWfDKCay0VkRYx6Alsk1jQ5oMiz01TmDs/edit).

Or see the Github [here](https://github.com/dokterkats/katDB). - Outdated for now, I will update it soon.
